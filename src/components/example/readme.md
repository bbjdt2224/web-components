# card-stack

#### Day 1

The card stack component is a simple example of how to display a group of elements on-top of each other. For design sake, we limit the maximum number of children than can render at a given time.

## Further Development

To take this example further, you would most likely extend the `.content` class element to render an actual card's contents. You would supply an interface shape for the `cards` property and have an animation for enter/leave on each individual card (if you wanted it to act like a slider).
